# Physics_Mathematics_Codes
- Codes I use in Physics and Mathematics Classes. 
- Written in Jupyter Python: 
   
    - Unit Conversion: example of using python to cnvert from mph to m/s
    - Scientific Notation: example of using python  display calculation in scientific notation.
    - Vector Addition: Jupyter notebook that computes the components of three vectors and then finds the resultant vector for the three vectors.
    - Vector Algebra: Jupyter notebook that finds an algebraic combination for two vectors.
    - Vector Multiplication: Jupyter notebook that calculates the dot product and the cross product of two vectors.
    - Average Velocity: Jupyter notebook that shows an example of average and instantaneous velocity calculations.
    - Constant Acceleration: Jupyter notebook that uses the constant acceleration equations for motion in one direction. 
    - Free Fall: Jupyter notebook that illustrates the concept of free fall.
    - 2-D Motion: Jupyter notebook that illustrates motion in two dimensions.
    - Projectile Motion: Jupyter notebook that illustrates the effect of launch angle on range of object in projectile motion.
    - Euler: Jupyter notebook that uses Euler methods to solve a differential equation with an initial condition.
    - Matrix Multiplication and Inverse: Illustrates finding the inverse of a matrix and multiplied two matrices.
    - Newton 1: Solves a sliding and hanging block problem, without friction, using Newton's laws of motion.
    - Newton 2: Solves the problem of hanging object by cords.
    - Newton 3: Solves an inclined object example.
    - Newton 4: Solves the problem of Newton's law with friction
    - Newton 5: Solves the problem of Newton's law for uniform circular motion
    - Work-Energy: applies the work-energy theorem to find final velocity of object
    - Work-Energy 2: applies the work-energy theorem to find final kinetic energy of object
