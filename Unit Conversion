# This is an example of unit conversion from miles per hour to meters per second.
# by MIchael Butros

# Identify the spped in miles per hour
S_mph = 763.0

# Identify needed conversion factors
mi_km = 1.609 #There are 1.609 kilometer in a mile
km_m = 1000 # There are 1000 meter in a kilometer
h_s = 3600 # there are 3600 seconds in an hour

# Now we can compute teh conversion
S_mps = (S_mph*mi_km*km_m)/h_s 

# Print the result
print('The speed in meters per second is:', end="")
print('%0.3f' %  S_mps)
